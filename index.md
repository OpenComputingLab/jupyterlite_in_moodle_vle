# Embedding Standalone Jupyter Environments in the OU Moodle VLE

Jupyter notebooks are used in a growing number of Open University (OU) modules to provide an interactive environment for delivering richly formatted teaching and learning materials that also support the execution of provided or student-generated computer code. Notebook environments are typically made available to students via the OU hosted OpenComputing Lab service, or self-installed and run locally on students' own computers.

This document describes how Jupyter notebooks can be delivered to students within the context of the OU VLE and without the need for an external server using `JupyterLite`.

As well as providing a resource reduction benefit, running Jupyter environments purely in the browser opens up the possibility of making interactive programming environments published via `learn7` available to students in secure enviroments.

Individual notebooks as well as the more general JupyterLab environment can be embedded via *URL* and HTML5 asset/resource types.
